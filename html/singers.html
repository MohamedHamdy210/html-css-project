  <h1>Eminem</h1>
<p> born October 17, 1972,  is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, film producer, and actor. He is consistently cited as one of the greatest and most influential artists of all time in hip hop, with Rolling Stone placing him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and labeling him the "King of Hip Hop".
After his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP, which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in U.S. sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction. He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, the second time he had the international best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15. These were followed by 2017's Revival and 2018's Kamikaze, the latter being the best-selling hip hop album of 2018.
In addition to his solo career, Eminem is an original member of the Midwest hip hop groups Soul Intent and D12. He is also known for his collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent. Eminem has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, he starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile playing himself, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose Yourself", becoming the first rap artist to ever win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010).

  <h1>Tamer Hosny  </h1>
  <p>born 16 August 1977 is an Egyptian singer, actor, composer, director and songwriter. He first came to public attention when he appeared on mix tapes with other Egyptian artists. Hosny launched his solo career with his 2004 album Hob, becoming a successful singer of romantic music and was given the nickname "King of the Generation" by his fans.
Tamer Hosny was born in Cairo to an Egyptian father and Syrian mother. Unlike his father, Hosny Sherif Abbas, Tamer Hosny grew up with an interest in football and played the sport for five years. Tamer Hosny had his first directorial experience in 2010 when directing his music video "Sa7eet 3la Sotha". Tamer had a long-held ambition to become a director and to make his own music video. Hosny starred in the 2003 Egyptian film Halet Hob (A State of Love).] In 2006, he was arrested for forging military papers to avoid serving in the army. He received a one-year prison sentence, yet he only stayed in jail for six months.
In 2012 he released "Omar & Salma 3", the third sequel to the Omar & Salma films. Hosny has frequently stated that he was not satisfied with the film. In a recent interview on the Set El Hosn program, he admitted that "I'm not happy with how the movie turned out, although many people love it and it was a box office success. I don't blame anyone else for that, I take responsibility for it. We had to make major plot changes due to financial reasons."
After three years away from the movie industry, he released Ahwak alongside Ghada Adel and Ahmed Malek. It is a romantic comedy about a young plastic surgeon who falls in love with a divorced woman. The film was a success at the box office, with total revenue of 22 million Egyptian pounds.
In 2017, Hosny released Tesbah ala kher (Good Night), a comedy drama about a wealthy entrepreneur who suffers from depression and hallucinations. Falcon films - the company responsible for distributing the movie in the Arab world - released an official statement saying that the movie has topped the box office in the Arab world.
