<h1>Mohamed Salah  </h1>
<p>مborn 15 June 1992 is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and the Egypt national team. He is considered Europe's top five leagues' fifth most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the CIES (as of 7 January 2019).[6]
Salah started his senior career with Cairo club El Mokawloon[7] in the Egyptian Premier League in 2010, departing shortly thereafter to join Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, he starred as he won the league title in his debut season, winning the SAFP Golden Player Award in the process. Salah's performances then attracted Premier League side Chelsea, and he joined the club for a £11 million fee in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentinaand Roma, with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million.
Following consistent match-winning performances in Rome to lead them to second-placed finish and a record points-tally in 2017, Salah relocated back to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million. During his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a complete forward and quickly became the focal point of the team. He would go on to break the club's scoring record for a debut season, receiving the Premier League Golden Boot after registering a record 32 goals in 36 league games. He also became the first player to win three Premier League Player of the Monthawards in the same season.
